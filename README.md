## What does this do?
This project will:
* Harvest (n) urls from target listing page
* Extract the plain text from each of these pages
* Use Natural Language Processing to extract and rank concepts from these articles
* Extract the number of interactions on Facebook for the target url and use this number as a multiplier for each found concept
* Aggregate all concept scores and return the top 5
* Use the Flickr API to retrieve a thumbnail image for each concept
